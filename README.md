# PokeMMO-fishing-bot
Pokemmon magikarp auto fishing bot

What you need for run this bot are the used python libraries and a 920x1080 resolution on screen,
the bot is just made for fishing in the safari zone but due to ban risk is not programmed to re-enter cone the balls are finished.
So you have to re enter, and go near the water yourself.

But once you are near the water if you put the game windows on max size (not fullscreen, you must see the upper bar)
you can open a terminal (possibly small size, on the bottom right corner), old rod on the last rapid slot, launch the script and let it fish for you 30 male magikarps.

Enjoy
